An alternative implementation in R of the original
[`allcontributors.org`](https://allcontributors.org/) to acknowledge all
contributors in your 'README' (or elsewhere). The original is intended to help
acknowledge *all* contributions including those beyond the contents of an
actual repository, such as community or other or less-tangible organisational
contributions. This version only acknowledges tangible contributions to
a repository, but automates that task to a single function call, in the hope
that such simplicity will spur greater usage. In short: This package can't do
everything the original does, but it makes what it does much easier.

## Why then?

The original [`allcontributors.org`](https://allcontributors.org/) is primarily
a bot which responds to commit messages such as `add @user for <contribution>`,
where `<contribution>` is one of the [recognized
types](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key). One
advantage of the original system is the diversity of
contribution types able to be acknowledged, with each type for a given user
appearing as a corresponding
[emoji](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) below their github
avatar as listed on the README. In comparison, this R package:

1. Works automatically, by calling `add_contributors()` at any time to add or
   update contributor acknowledgements.
2. Works locally without any bot integration
3. Can add contributors to any file, not just the main README
4. Offers a variety of formats for listing contributors:
   (i) divided into sections by types of contributions, or as a single section
   (ii) presented as full grids (like [the
        original](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors/blob/master/README.md#contributors-)),
        numbered lists of github user names only, or single text strings of
        comma-separated names.

This ease of automation means you can easily update your contributors list with
a [simple GitHub
workflow](https://github.com/ropensci/allcontributors/blob/main/.github/workflows/allcontributors.yml),
set to update at some regular interval. Your contributor list will then be kept
up-to-date without you having to remember or do anything.

## Installation

The package is on CRAN, and can be installed with,
```{r cran-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages ("allcontributors")
```

Alternatively, a development version can be installed by enabling the
"ropensci" repository from
[r-universe](https://ropensci.r-universe.dev):

```{r}
options (repos = c (
    ropensci = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev",
    CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))
```

The `install.packages()` command will then install the development version.
Alternatively, any of the following options may be used for those who prefer
not to use GitHub:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_git ("https://git.sr.ht/~ropensci/allcontributors")
remotes::install_git ("https://codeberg.org/mpadge/allcontributors")
remotes::install_bitbucket ("mpadge/allcontributors")
remotes::install_gitlab ("mpadge/allcontributors")
remotes::install_github ("mpadge/allcontributors")
```

The package can then be loaded the usual way:
```{r load-fakey, eval = TRUE}
library (allcontributors)
```

## Usage

The primary function of the package,
[`add_contributors()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/allcontributors/reference/add_contributors.html),
adds a table of all contributors by default to the main `README.md` file (and
`README.Rmd` if that exists). Tables or lists can be added to other files by
specifying the `files` argument of that function. The appearance of the
contributors table is determined by several parameters in that function,
including:

1. `type` For the type of contributions to include (code, contributors who open
   issues, contributors who discuss issues).
2. `num_sections` For whether to present contributors in 1, 2, or 3 distinct
   sections, dependent upon which `type`s of contributions are to be
   acknowledged.
3. `format` Determining whether contributors are presented in a grid with
   associated avatars of each contributor, as in [the
   original](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors/blob/master/README.md#contributors-), 
   an enumerated list of github user names only, or a single text string of
   comma-separated names.

Contribution data are obtained by querying the github API, for which a local
key should be set as an environmental variable containing the name `"GITHUB"`
(either via `Sys.setenv()`, or as an equivalent entry in a file `~/.Renviron`).

If the main `README` file(s) contains a markdown section entitled
`"Contributors"`, the
[`add_contributors()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/allcontributors/reference/add_contributors.html)
function will add a table of contributors there, otherwise it will be appended
to the end of the document(s). If you wish your contributors table to be
somewhere other than at the end of the `README` file(s), start by adding an
empty `"## Contributors` section to the file(s) and the function will insert
the table at that point.

Any time you wish to update your contributor list, simply re-run the
`add_contributors()` function. There's even an `open_issue` parameter that will
automatically open or update a github issue on your repository so that
contributors will be pinged about them being added to your list of
contributors.

The data used to construct the contributions table can also be extracted
without writing to the `README` file(s) with the function
[`get_contributors()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/allcontributors/reference/get_contributors.html):

```{r get_contributors-data, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
dat <- data.frame (
    logins = c ("mpadge", "maelle", "shamindras", "assignUser"),
    contributions = c (176L, rep (NA_integer_, 3L)),
    avatar = c (
        "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6697851?v=4",
        "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8360597?u=824f03caa87c92420352e3dd9a05470320a67412&v=4",
        "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7627188?u=d05fb551796e6ce6db64ae43cd8ce48a0217ef85&v=4",
        "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16141871?u=bbf2ca4641e8ec034a9cdb583e62e3a94c372824&v=4"
    ),
    type = c ("code", rep ("issue_authors", 3L))
)
```
```{r get_contributors-fakey, eval = FALSE}
get_contributors (org = "ropensci", repo = "allcontributors")
```
```{r get_contributors-output, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
cat (cli::col_green (cli::symbol$tick), " Extracted code contributors\n")
cat (cli::col_green (cli::symbol$tick), " Extracted github issue contributors\n")
cat (cli::col_green (cli::symbol$tick), " Downloaded GitHub URLs\n")
print (dat)
```


## Keeping your allcontributors Acknowledgements up-to-date

The "Contributors" sections of files can be updated at any time by calling
calling
[`add_contributors()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/allcontributors/reference/add_contributors.html).
If your contributors have not changed then your lists of acknowledgements will
not be changed. The most direct way to update your allcontributors list is to
remember to manually call that function.

### A GitHub Workflow

This package also includes a [GitHub workflow
file](https://github.com/ropensci/allcontributors/blob/main/.github/workflows/allcontributors.yml)
which you can simply copy and add to your own repository. Once pushed with your
repository, this workflow will be automatically run at the default monthly
interval (or whatever value you interval you wish to change that to), your
README file updated, and the result committed to your repository. Your
allcontributors list will then be automatically updated without you having to
do anything.

### A `usethis::use_release_issue()` check item

Many people use the [`usethis::use_release_issue()`
function](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_release_issue.html) to
automatically open an issue on GitHub containing a checklist to help prepare
for package releases. You can easily add an additional checklist item to this
list by including the following function somewhere in your package code:

```{r}
release_bullets <- function () {
    "Run `allcontributors::add_contributors()`"
}
```

The function should return a single text item (which you can modify to suit
your own needs), and that will be automatically added to the checklist item
created on calling the [`usethis::use_release_issue()`
function](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_release_issue.html).


### Forcing updates

The
[`add_contributors()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/allcontributors/reference/add_contributors.html)
function has an additional parameter which may be set to `force_update = TRUE`
to force lists to be updated regardless of whether contributions have changed.
This can be used to change the formats of acknowledgements at any time. If
anything goes wrong, the easiest way to replace a contributions section is to
simply delete the old ones from all files, and call
[`add_contributors()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/allcontributors/reference/add_contributors.html)
again.


## More Information

The package has a [single
vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/allcontributors/articles/allcontributors.html)
which visually demonstrates the various formats in which an "allcontributors"
section can be presented.
